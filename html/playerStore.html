        <h1>Player Store</h1>
        <p>Throughout your player's career, you can make purchases in the Player Store using your earned money. <b>Each
                purchase must be posted in the Store thread and be approved by an Accountant before you are able to
                claim your purchase on your update page.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            This page allows you to look through the purchaseable items and select what you want to purchase and then
            exporting a correctly formatted text that can be copied in the Store thread. If you are logged in on the
            forum, the Store will also automatically read your current bank status and tell you if you do not have
            coverage for your purchase.
